# Perform_Data_Cleaning-Airbnb.com-
In this project, we will apply learned concepts from Day 1-2 lectures to perform data cleaning on a given Airbnb data set.

This dataset (raw.csv) contains 30k+ records on hotels in the top-10 tourist destinations and major US metropolitan areas sraped from Airbnb.com. Each data record has 40 attributes including the number of bedrooms, price, location, etc. The attribute "pop2016" means population of the zipcode location (area) in year 2016. Demographic and economic attributes were scraped from city-data.com.
